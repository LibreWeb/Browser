LibreWeb Browser is a fully decentralized free software and open-source Web Browser. 
Allowing users to easily browse and host new content on the decentralized web. Build on top of IPFS.

Decentralization comes with many benefits like resilient to censorship and no single point of failure.

I was inspired by Douglas Engelbart, Tim Berners-Lee and Ted Nelson as well as projects like IPFS, Jekyll and ARPANET.
